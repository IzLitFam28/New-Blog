So, today I've learned a lot about making blog. 
Turns out I am pretty lucky to find using the github method 
because using local files to make a blog is pretty tiresome.

This is the [website](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages-b/content/3-blog.html) 
that I found to make this blog.
Props to the people who made that!
